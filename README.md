# 🌐 Web Application Testing on Guru99 🕵️‍♂️

Welcome to my **Web Application Testing** project! 🚀 This project focuses on testing the open-source demo web application from **Guru99**. I wrote comprehensive test cases and created a detailed bug report to ensure the application is bug-free and smooth to use. 🛠️

## 🌟 What's Inside?

### 🔍 Key Focus Areas:
- **Login & Registration**: Thorough testing of the user authentication process, covering all possible scenarios.
- **Navigation & Functionality**: Ensured smooth and intuitive navigation across the web pages.
- **Accounts Operation**
- **Deposite & Withdrawal** 

### 📝 Test Case Template:

For this project, I used a structured template to write the test cases, similar to the one I used in my mobile app testing project. The columns are as follows:

- **Test Condition**
- **ID**
- **Steps Description**
- **Actual Result**
- **Pass/Fail**
- **Defect ID**


### 🐞 Bug Report:

During testing, I documented all the bugs found using a detailed bug report template. Here's what the bug report includes:

- **Bug ID**
- **Description**
- **Test Data**
- **Actual Result**
- **Expected Result**
- **Priority**
- **Severity**
- **Attachment**


## 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out:
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Every possible scenario has been covered.
- **Clear Documentation**: Each bug is well-documented with all relevant details.
- **Real-World Application**: Tested on a popular demo site used for learning and practicing testing skills.

## 📸 Screenshot Time!
